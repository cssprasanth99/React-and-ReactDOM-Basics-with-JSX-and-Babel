Reflection:
Using traditional JavaScript, manipulating the DOM directly involves selecting elements, modifying their properties or content, handling events, and managing state manually. This approach can quickly become complex and error-prone, especially in large applications.

React's approach, on the other hand, is declarative. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you describe how your UI should look at any given point in time, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM to match this description efficiently.

Benefits of React's declarative UI elements over direct DOM manipulation include:

Simplified Code: React abstracts away the complexity of managing DOM updates, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
Component-Based Architecture: React encourages a modular and reusable component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and scale complex UIs.
Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM enables efficient updates by only re-rendering components that have changed, minimizing DOM manipulation and improving performance.
State Management: React provides a clear and predictable way to manage component state, leading to more predictable UI behavior.
Ecosystem and Tooling: React has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that further enhance developer productivity and project maintainability
